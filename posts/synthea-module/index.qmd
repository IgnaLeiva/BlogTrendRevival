This is the [final report](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/49d506d7db544a35905f/) from the **Health for the
Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology**. They also prepared the module [Companion Guide for AML](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/f/2a1435a318834be5a7c9/)

# Pre settings for the MM module

## The Visio Diagram
## Define the modules states

Myeloma Multple States need to provide details about each clinical state modeled. Table provided information on that. 


| State Name   | Type    | State Details   | Codification |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| Initial | Initial  | Initial module required by Synthea | n/a     |
|         | Delay  | Delay in years for a percentage of the individuas after birth before progressing to blank state | n/a |

## Modules parameters

Module Parameters summarizes the probabilities used to construct the module. A state moves to another considering each branch, the values that each branch takes can range from 0-1, and multiples branch are present, their sum should be 1. This are probabilities.

| Parameter   | Value    | Comments/ref   |
|--------------|---------|----------------|
| Probability of age at time of MM diagnosis | 1  | n/a | 
|
