	abstract = {Abstract We performed retrospective analysis of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) patients previously exposed to daratumumab treated with ixazomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone (IRd) regimen in real clinical practice. Our aim was to evaluate efficacy of IRd in these patients and select a subset of patients that would benefit from this treatment the most. In total, we analyzed 43 daratumumab-exposed RRMM patients treated in our center. Minimal response or better was achieved by 53.5\% of patients from the cohort. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 4.56 months (95\% CI: 2.56, 8.03) and median overall survival (OS) was 28.92 months (95\% CI: 5.4, NR). Duration of response (DOR) was evaluable in 28 patients and reached a median of 21.3 months (95\% CI: 6.85, NR). Next, we evaluated hazard ratios (HR) for OS and PFS. There was improved OS in patients that were not-triple refractory or worse (HR = 0.39, 95\%Cl (0.14; 1.10), p = .07) and in patients, that had less than three previous lines of treatment (LOT) (HR = 0.13, 95\%Cl (0.03; 0.6) p = .003). Similar to OS, there was improved PFS in patients, that were not triple-refractory or worse (HR = 0.52, 95\%Cl (0.25; 1.10), p = .08). We concluded, that the best survival benefit for RRMM patients pretreated with daratumumab to IRd regimen was observed in patients that were not triple-refractory and had less than three previous lines of treatment (LOT). The DOR in these patients was 21.3 months (95\% CI: 6.85, NR).},

@article{Touzeau2021aa,
	abstract = {Over the past decade, several drugs have been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This retrospective study, using the French National Healthcare database (SNDS), describes the treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with RRMM treated in real-world clinical practice in France. Patients were adults, with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, who initiated second-line (2L) treatment approved for use in France between 2014 and 2018; this included bortezomib, carfilzomib, daratumumab, ixazomib, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide. Data were analyzed overall, by first-line (1L) autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) status and by lenalidomide treatment status at 2L. In total, 12987 patients with RRMM were included in the study (mean age 69.5 years); 27{\%} received an ASCT at 1L, and 30{\%} received a lenalidomide-sparing regimen at 2L. Overall, and among the ASCT and non-ASCT subgroups, most patients received a bortezomib-based regimen at 1L, whereas lenalidomide-based regimens were most common at 2L. Among patients who received a lenalidomide-sparing regimen at 2L, this was most often a proteasome inhibitor-based regimen. Mortality rate was 26.1/100 person-years, and median (95{\%} confidence interval) survival from 2L initiation was 32.4 (31.2--33.6) months. Survival differed by various factors, shorter survival was reported in the non-ASCT group, those receiving a lenalidomide-sparing regimen at 2L, older patients (≥70 years), and those with multiple comorbidities. This analysis provides insight into the real-world use of approved novel MM treatments and highlights an ongoing unmet need to improve outcomes, particularly for selected patient groups.},
